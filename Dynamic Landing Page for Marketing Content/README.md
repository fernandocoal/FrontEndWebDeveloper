##Index

This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. 
Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with (each with its respective class and id).

##App

Using javascript, it dynamically builds the navigation page. In the other hand it shows the current "active" section in the page and scrolls the page to the "clicked" section in the menu.

##Running
Easily done by cloning the repo and opening the index.html file in your browser (chrome, mozilla, explorer...).
